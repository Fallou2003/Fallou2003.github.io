<p> Welcome to my About Me page!
    <p> My name is Fallou ba, I am currently at URI double majoring in computer science and tmd(fashion) graduating in the class of 2026. <br>
    I work at a pizza shop in woonsocket and save up to start my own clothing brand hopefully by january of 2023.<br>
   My passion lies in fashion and design, I like to sew and am currently working on it to improve my skills.
        <br>  I also love too create outfits and go out to take pictures with my friends. making memories with the people I love is very important to me.<br
I also love anime and soccer, both were very crucial to my life gvrowing up and both have got me through tough times. Although my goal<br>
        is to become a fashion designer and computer science is just a "safe " choice ive grown to really enjoy coding and I hope I can go farn with it and live a comfortable life.
